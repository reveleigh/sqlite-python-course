                  <img src="../images/bookmark-book.svg" /> Creating From Scratch: Building a <span class="redacted">Database</span> with CREATE
                </h5>
                <p class="concept">
                  Imagine constructing a new building. You wouldn't start by haphazardly placing bricks and mortar; you'd begin with a blueprint, a plan that outlines the structure and organization of the building. Similarly, in the world of <span class="redacted">databases</span>, the <span class="redacted">CREATE</span> statement acts as your blueprint, allowing you to define the structure of your database and its constituent <span class="redacted">tables</span> from the ground up.
                </p>
                <p class="concept">
                  The <span class="redacted">CREATE</span> statement is a powerful tool that empowers you to bring <span class="redacted">databases</span> and <span class="redacted">tables</span> into existence. It's akin to an architect's pen, sketching out the framework of your data storage. With <span class="redacted">CREATE</span>, you can specify the name of your database, the names and data types of your tables' columns, and even constraints to ensure data integrity.
                </p>
                <p class="concept">
                  For instance, to create a <span class="redacted">database</span> named "my_database" with a <span class="redacted">table</span> called "users" containing columns for "id," "name," and "email," you would use a series of <span class="redacted">CREATE</span> statements, each carefully crafted to define the structure and properties of your database and its tables.
                </p>
                <p class="concept">
                  The <span class="redacted">CREATE</span> statement is the foundation upon which you build your <span class="redacted">database</span>, a testament to your ability to shape and mold data structures to your will. It's the starting point of your database journey, a blank canvas upon which you can paint your data masterpiece.

                <h2 class="card-title">Creating a Database</h2>
                <p>Before we can start adding data to a database, we need to create the database itself. We will use the <code>CREATE DATABASE</code> statement to do this.</p>
