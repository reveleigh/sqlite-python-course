          <h2 class="card-title">Lesson Overview</h2>
          <p>
            In this lesson, we will look at some world population data publish
            by the World Bank. We will learn how to narrow down our results by
            using the ORDER BY clause to sort our data in ascending or
            descending order. We will also use the LIMIT clause to restrict the
            number of rows returned by our query. We'll cover the following:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>ORDER BY:</b> Returning results in ascending or descending
              order using in SQLite.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>LIMIT:</b> Restricting the number of rows returned by a query.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Creating a GUI:</b> Using Python's Tkinter library to create a
              simple interface which allows input of a country name and returns
              a list of countries with a similar population.

              Bringing Order to Chaos
            </h5>
            <p class="concept">
              In the realm of data retrieval, order and brevity can be
              invaluable virtues. Imagine sifting through a sprawling record of
              the world's population with entries haphazardly arranged and no
              end in sight. The <span class="redacted">ORDER BY</span> and
              <span class="redacted">LIMIT</span> clauses in SQL provide the
              means to impose order and conciseness on your query results,
              transforming potential chaos into manageable information.
            </p>

              <img src="../images/bookmark-book.svg" /> ORDER BY: Arranging Your
              Data
            </h5>
            <p class="concept">
              The <span class="redacted">ORDER BY</span> clause allows you to
              sort your results based on one or more columns. This is akin to
              arranging a world population register by country name, population,
              or any other relevant metric. By specifying the column and the
              desired sort order (<span class="redacted">ASC</span> for
              ascending, <span class="redacted">DESC</span> for descending), you
              can bring a sense of structure to your output.
            </p>

              <img src="../images/bookmark-book.svg" /> LIMIT: Trimming the Fat
            </h5>
            <p class="concept">
              The <span class="redacted">LIMIT</span> clause, on the other hand,
              allows you to restrict the number of rows returned by your query.
              This is particularly useful when dealing with a large population
              dataset where retrieving all rows would be impractical or
              overwhelming. By specifying a
              <span class="redacted">LIMIT</span> value, you can focus on a
              specific subset of the data.
            </p>

            <p class="concept">
              Together, the <span class="redacted">ORDER BY</span> and
              <span class="redacted">LIMIT</span> clauses provide a powerful
              combination for managing and presenting your data in a clear and
              concise manner, bringing a sense of calm order to the potentially
              overwhelming world of information retrieval.

                Open DB Browser and load the world_population.db file. Click on

              Conventions
            </h5>
            <p class="concept">
              You might have noticed a slight oddity in our
              <span class="redacted">database</span>: the
              <span class="redacted">fields</span> representing years like 1961
              are named like "_1961" rather than simply "1961". This isn't a
              typographical error, but rather a necessity imposed by the rules
              of <span class="redacted">SQL</span> naming conventions.
            </p>
            <p class="concept">
              In <span class="redacted">SQL</span>, names (whether for tables or
              fields) cannot begin with a <span class="redacted">number</span>.
              This seemingly arbitrary rule is rooted in the way
              <span class="redacted">SQL</span> parses and interprets your
              commands. A name starting with a number could be confused with a
              numeric value, leading to
              <span class="redacted">syntax errors</span> or unexpected
              behaviour.
            </p>
            <p class="concept">
              To <span class="redacted">circumvent</span> this constraint, we
              adopt the convention of prefixing such names with an underscore.
              This simple addition ensures that the name is
              <span class="redacted">valid</span> while still conveying its
              intended meaning.

          </h5>
          <p>
            You will have noticed that the database is ordered alphabetically by
            country name. However, we may prefer to oder the data by population
            in ascending or descending order. Let's try this out.
          </p>

              <img src="../images/task-list.svg" />
              Task: Sorting Data by Population
            </h5>
            <ol>
              <li>
                In the Execute SQL tab, run the following query to sort the data
                by population in ascending order:
                <pre><code>SELECT country_name, _1961 FROM world_population ORDER BY _1961 ASC</code></pre>
                If this is successful, you should see the below output:
                <img
                  class="screenshot"
                  src="screenshots/countries-asc.png"
                  alt="Order by ASC"
                />
              </li>
              <li>
                Now, try sorting the data in descending order by running the
                following query:
                <pre><code>SELECT country_name, _1961 FROM population_data ORDER BY _1961 DESC</code></pre>
                If this is successful, you should see the below output:
                <img
                  class="screenshot"
                  src="screenshots/countries-desc.png"
                  alt="Order by DESC"
                />
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <p>
            By using the ORDER BY clause, you can arrange your data in a way
            that makes it easier to interpret and analyse. Whether you're
            sorting by population, country name, or any other relevant metric,
            this feature allows you to bring order to the chaos of raw data.

                "country_name" and "_1999" columns, which represents the
                country's name and its population in the year 1999,

          <p>
            If we were to replace <code>DESC</code> with <code>ASC</code> (short
            for "ascending"), the results would be sorted in the opposite order,
            from lowest population to highest. This would give us a list of
            countries starting with the least populous in 1999 and ending with
            the most populous.

          <p>
            In addition to sorting your data, you may also want to limit the
            number of rows returned by your query. This can be useful when
            dealing with large datasetsor when you only need to focus on a
            specific subset of the data. Let's explore how to use the LIMIT

            <p class="concept">
              When querying a database, especially one as extensive as a world

              <span class="redacted">impractical</span> and inefficient to
              retrieve every single record. The LIMIT
              <span class="redacted">clause</span> in SQL provides a mechanism
              for exercising restraint, allowing you to

            creating a simple GUI that allows users to input a country name and

            <p class="concept">
              You will recall that the
              <span class="redacted">LIMIT clause</span> in SQL allows you to
              restrict the number of rows returned by a query. In this Python
              snippet, we achieve a similar outcome through the
              <code><span class="redacted">fetchone()</span> </code> method.

              could potentially return multiple rows if multiple countries had
              the same name, <code>cursor.fetchone()</code> retrieves only the
              <span class="redacted">first</span> row. This effectively acts
              like a <code><span class="redacted">LIMIT 1</span></code> clause,
              ensuring that we obtain only a single population value for the
              specified country and year.

            <p class="concept">
              If we wanted to retrieve more than one row, we could use the

          <p>
            In this lesson, we explored the power of the ORDER BY and LIMIT
            clauses in SQL, which allow you to sort and restrict the results of
            your queries. By using ORDER BY, you can arrange your data in
            ascending or descending order based on one or more columns,
            enhancing the organization and readability of your output. The LIMIT
            clause enables you to focus on a specific subset of the data by
            restricting the number of rows returned by your query. Together,
            these clauses provide a powerful combination for managing and
            presenting your data in a clear and concise manner, bringing a sense
            of calm order to the potentially overwhelming world of information
            retrieval.
