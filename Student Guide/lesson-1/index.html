              Picture a quiet, unassuming <span class="redacted">library</span>,
              residing modestly within your computer. SQLite is a humble
              <span class="redacted">database</span> system that allows you to
              organise your <span class="redacted">data</span> with a sense of
              calm efficiency. It uses a language called SQL (Structured Query
              Language) to manage this data, but unlike those grand databases
              that require an imposing server and speak many dialects of SQL,
              SQLite is content in a single
              <span class="redacted">file</span> with its own specific version
              of the language.

          <h2 class="card-title">Creating a Database and Tables</h2>
          <p>
            Imagine acquiring a new, empty bookcase for your quiet library.
            Before you can begin organising your collection, you must first
            prepare the shelves. In the world of SQLite, this translates to
            creating a database and defining its structure with tables.
          </p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Creating a Database</h5>
          <p>
            A database is like that bookcase â€“ a container to hold and organise
            your information. In SQLite, this container is a single file,
            residing unobtrusively on your computer. To create this file, we'll
            use DB Browser for SQLite:
          </p>
          <div class="task-box">

            <ol>
              <li>
                Open DB Browser for SQLite.<br />

                <img
                  class="screenshot"
                  src="screenshots/new-database.png"

                />
              </li>
              <li>Click on "New Database" in the toolbar.</li>
              <li>
                Choose a location to save the database file and give it a
                fitting name, such as "bookshelf.db".
              </li>
              <li>Click "Save".</li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <p>
            You've now brought your new, empty bookcase into existence. It
            awaits the careful arrangement of your information.
          </p>
          <!-- Start Creating Tables-->
          <h5 class="card-title">Creating Tables</h5>
          <p>
            Within your bookcase, you'll want to organise your books into
            categories. Perhaps you'll have a shelf for fiction, another for
            non-fiction, and another for poetry. In SQLite, these categories are
            called tables.
          </p>
          <p>
            A table is a structured collection of data, organised into rows and
            columns. Each row represents a single item (like a book), and each
            column represents a specific attribute of that item (like its title,
            author, or genre).
          </p>
          <p>Let's create a table to store information about books:</p>

          <div class="task-box">
            <h5 class="card-title">
              <img src="../images/task-list.svg" /> Task: Create a "books" Table
            </h5>
            <ol>
              <li>In DB Browser, go to the "Create Table" tab.</li>
              <li>Enter "books" as the table name.</li>
              <li>Now, define the columns for your table:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>id:</b> A unique identifier for each book (INTEGER data
                  type, Primary Key, and check the "Autoincrement" box).
                </li>
                <li><b>title:</b> The title of the book (TEXT data type).</li>
                <li><b>author:</b> The author of the book (TEXT data type).</li>
                <li><b>genre:</b> The genre of the book (TEXT data type).</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Click "OK" to create the table.</li>
            </ol>
            <img

            />
          </div>
          <!--- end task-box-->
          <p>
            You've now created your first table, akin to adding a new shelf to
            your bookcase and labelling it "books". It's ready to receive the
            details of your literary collection.
          </p>

          <!--- start CRUD Operations -->
          <h2 class="card-title">CRUD Operations</h2>
          <p>
            Now that we've laid the groundwork, it's time to populate our newly
            created database. This involves the core of database interaction:
            <b>CRUD operations</b>.

              <img src="../images/bookmark-book.svg" /> What is CRUD?
            </h5>
            <p>CRUD is an acronym that stands for:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Create:</b> Adding new <span class="redacted">data</span> to
                your tables.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Read:</b> <span class="redacted">Retrieving</span> data from
                your tables.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Update:</b> Modifying existing
                <span class="redacted">data</span> in your tables.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Delete:</b> <span class="redacted">Removing</span> data from
                your tables.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These four operations are the fundamental building blocks for
              interacting with any <span class="redacted">database</span>, and
              SQLite is no exception.

          <h5 class="card-title">Creating Records</h5>
          <p>
            Imagine carefully placing books onto your newly built shelves. Each
            book represents a record, a single entry in your database table. To
            add a book to your "books" table, we'll use the "Browse Data" tab in
            DB Browser:

                  <li>
                    You can skip the "id" field, as it's set to auto-increment.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Enter the title, author, and genre of the book. For example:

                        <b>Title:</b> The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and

            observe how easily you can manage your data without writing any
            code. This modest practice will prepare you for further exploration
            of CRUD operations.

          <h5 class="card-title">Reading Records</h5>
          <p>
            Having diligently populated your database, it's time to delve into
            the art of retrieval. In the hushed confines of our library analogy,
            this equates to selecting a book from its designated shelf and
            perusing its contents. Within DB Browser, this translates to viewing
            and filtering your data with quiet efficiency.
          </p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Viewing Data in DB Browser</h5>
          <p>
            DB Browser offers a straightforward way to view your data without
            the need for complex commands. To view the contents of your "books"
            table:

            To see the same view as the above screenshot, load the
            'bookshelf.db' from the lesson resource folder.
          </div>

          <p>
            The table's contents will be displayed, revealing the fruits of your
            earlier labours. Each row represents a book, and each column
            displays a specific attribute. Observe the unassuming orderliness
            with which your data is presented.
          </p>

              Browser
            </h5>
            <p>
              DB Browser also allows you to
              <span class="redacted">filter</span> your data, akin to searching
              for a specific book on your shelf. To filter your data, you can
              use the search bar at the top of the
              <span class="redacted">table view</span>. For instance, to find
              all books with "the" in the title, simply type "the" into the
              search bar. DB Browser will quietly update the display, showing
              only the matching <span class="redacted">records</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
              While this graphical approach offers a certain ease, there lies a
              more powerful method for retrieving data:
              <span class="redacted">SQL commands</span>. These commands provide
              a precise and flexible way to

          <h5 class="card-title">Updating Records</h5>
          <p>
            Even in our meticulously organised collections, change is
            inevitable. In our library analogy, this might involve correcting a
            book's details, such as its author or genre. DB Browser allows us to
            modify existing records with ease.
          </p>

              <img src="../images/task-list.svg" /> Task: Update a Book Record
            </h5>
            To modify a record in your "books" table:

            <ol>
              <li>Go to the "Browse Data" tab.</li>
              <li>Select the "books" table.</li>
              <li>
                Locate the record and double-click the cell you wish to change.
              </li>
              <li>Make the necessary adjustments.</li>
              <li>Click "Write Changes" to save your changes.</li>

              alt="Update a record"

            In this example, I've updated the genre the book to "Computer
            Science" instead of "Media Studies"

          <p>DB Browser facilitates these alterations with quiet efficiency.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Deleting Records</h5>
          <p>
            Occasionally, the need arises to remove items from our carefully
            curated collections. In our library analogy, this might involve
            discarding a worn-out volume or removing a title that no longer
            aligns with our interests. DB Browser provides a straightforward
            means to delete records from your database.

              <li>Select the "books" table.</li>
              <li>
                Locate the record you wish to remove and click on the row number
                to select it.
              </li>
              <li>Click the "Delete Record" button.</li>
              <li>Confirm the deletion.</li>

          <h2 class="card-title">Lesson Summary</h2>
          <p>
            In this lesson, we've embarked on our journey into the world of
            SQLite and DB Browser. We've learned how to create a new database,
            define tables, and interact with our data using CRUD operations.

              Graphical Interface
            </h5>
            <p>
              Having explored the subdued comforts of DB Browser's graphical
              interface, it's time to consider the broader landscape of
              <span class="redacted">SQLite</span> interaction. While DB Browser
              provides an approachable
              <span class="redacted">entry point</span>, the true power of
              SQLite lies in its
              <span class="redacted">command-line interface</span> and its
              ability to integrate with
              <span class="redacted">programming languages</span> like
              <span class="redacted">Python</span>.
            </p>

            <h5 class="card-title">
              <img src="../images/bookmark-book.svg" /> The Command-Line
              Interface and SQL
            </h5>
            <p>
              Beneath the unassuming exterior of DB Browser lies the
              <span class="redacted">command-line</span> interface, where you
              can interact with SQLite using
              <span class="redacted">SQL commands</span>. These commands offer a
              precise and flexible way to
              <span class="redacted">manipulate</span> your database, allowing
              for more complex operations and
              <span class="redacted">fine-grained</span>
              control over your data. For instance, you can use SQL commands to:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Retrieve specific records based on complex criteria.</li>
              <li>
                Perform <span class="redacted">calculations</span> on your data.
              </li>
              <li>
                Modify multiple records with a single
                <span class="redacted">command</span>.
              </li>
              <li>And much more.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              While the command-line interface may seem
              <span class="redacted">austere</span> at first glance, it offers a
              deeper level of engagement with SQLite, allowing you to harness
              its full potential.
