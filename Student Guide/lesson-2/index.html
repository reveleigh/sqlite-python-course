          <p>
            In this lesson, we'll explore how to interact with SQLite databases
            using SQL commands within DB Browser. We'll cover:
          </p>

            <li>
              <b>A New Database - <i>entertainment.db</i>:</b> A more
              comprehensive dataset for practicing SQL queries.
            </li>

            </h5>
            <p class="concept">
              While DB Browser's graphical interface provides a gentle
              introduction to SQLite, the true power of this database system
              lies in its ability to understand and respond to
              <span class="redacted">SQL commands</span>. These commands offer a
              precise and <span class="redacted">flexible</span> way to interact
              with your data, allowing you to perform tasks that would be
              cumbersome or impossible with the graphical
              <span class="redacted">interface</span> alone.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h2 class="card-title">A New Database</h2>
          <p>
            For this lesson, we'll be working with a new database called
            "entertainment.db". This database contains information about popular
            80s movies and top selling music albums. To proceed, please open
            this database in DB Browser.
          </p>

          <div class="task-box">

              <li>
                Locate the "entertainment.db" file and click "Open".
                <p>
                  You should now see the "entertainment.db" database loaded in
                  DB Browser, with the "movies_80s" and "top_albums" tables
                  listed in the "Database Structure" tab.

                Take a moment to browse the data, play with filters and get a
                sense of the size of the data set.

          <h5 class="card-title">Exploring the "entertainment.db" Dataset</h5>
          <p>
            The "entertainment.db" database offers a somewhat limited but
            nonetheless potentially interesting repository of information for
            practising your SQL querying skills. It houses two tables, each with
            a distinct set of attributes:
          </p>

          <div class="concept-box">

              entertainment.db
            </h5>
            <p class="concept"></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>"movies_80s"</b>: A
                <span class="redacted">collection</span> of films from the
                1980s, meticulously ranked from 1 to 10 based on
                <span class="redacted">ticket sales</span> for each year. It
                includes details such as title, release date, distributor, and
                genre. One could, for example, query this table to uncover the
                most <span class="redacted">popular</span> genres of the decade
                or to track the performance of a particular
                <span class="redacted">distributor</span> over time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>"top_albums"</b>: A compilation of Rolling Stone magazine's
                top 500 albums of all time, as judged in 2012. Or at least, most
                of them. A few entries have been
                <span class="redacted">discreetly removed</span> to ensure this
                tutorial remains suitable for younger audiences, so you may find
                some unexpected gaps in the rankings. The table provides
                information on the ranking, year of release, album title,
                artist, genre, and subgenre. One might, with sufficient effort,
                use SQL to identify trends in musical taste across different
                <span class="redacted">eras</span> or to
                <span class="redacted">analyse</span> the representation of
                various genres within the list.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            With these datasets at your disposal, the possibilities for
            exploration are perhaps not endless, but certainly sufficient for
            our current purposes. But how does one access and analyse this
            information? The "Execute SQL" tab provides the means.
          </p>

          <h2 class="card-title">The "Execute SQL" Tab</h2>
          <p>
            The "Execute SQL" tab in DB Browser is your interface for
            interacting with these datasets using SQL commands. Here, you can
            construct queries to retrieve specific data, filter records based on
            certain criteria, and perform basic calculations.
          </p>

          <p>
            To access this tab, simply click on "Execute SQL" in DB Browser.
            You'll be presented with a text editor for composing your SQL
            queries and a button to execute them. The results will be displayed
            below, offering a glimpse into the patterns and trends hidden within
            the data.

            <ol>
              <li>Open the "Execute SQL" tab in DB Browser.</li>
              <li>
                Type the following SQL query into the query editor:
                <pre><code>SELECT title, release_date FROM movies_80s WHERE rank = 1</code></pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                Press the "Execute" button (looks like the play icon)
                <p>
                  The query result should display the title of the top-ranked
                  movie in the "movies_80s" table from each year, as shown
                  below:

                  alt="Top films"
                />
              </li>
              <li>
                Try changing the ranking to a higher number. Do you still
                recognise the film?
              </li>

          </div>

          <p>
            In the following sections, we'll examine the fundamental SQL clauses
            that will enable you to navigate and analyse these datasets with a
            modicum of confidence.
          </p>

          <h2 class="card-title">SELECT, FROM, WHERE</h2>
          <p>
            The SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses are the building blocks of SQL
            queries. They allow you to specify what data you want to retrieve
            and under what conditions. Let's break down each clause:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>SELECT:</b> Specifies the columns you want to retrieve from the
              database.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>FROM:</b> Specifies the table from which you want to retrieve
              the data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>WHERE:</b> Filters the records based on specific conditions.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="concept-box">
            <h5 class="card-title">
              <img src="../images/bookmark-book.svg" /> The WHERE Clause: Your
              Data Detective
            </h5>
            <p class="concept">
              In the world of SQL, the <code>WHERE</code> clause acts like a
              detective, helping you pinpoint exactly the information you need
              from your database. Think of it as a filter that sifts through
              your data and only reveals the records that match your specific
              criteria.
            </p>

            <h5 class="card-title">
              <img src="../images/bookmark-book.svg" /> WHERE in Action:
              "80s_movies"
            </h5>
            <p class="concept">
              Let's say you want to find all the movies in your "<span
                class="redacted"
                >movies_80s</span
              >" table that were <span class="redacted">distributed</span> by
              Warner Bros. You would use the WHERE
              <span class="redacted">clause</span> with a condition
            </p>

            <pre><code>SELECT * FROM movies_80s WHERE <span class="redacted">distributor = 'Warner Bros'</span></code></pre>

            <p class="concept">
              This query tells the database: "Show me all the columns
              <span class="redacted">(*)</span> from the 'movies_80s' table, but
              only where the 'distributor' field is equal to 'Warner Bros.'"
            </p>

            <h5 class="card-title">WHERE's Versatility</h5>
            <p class="concept">
              The WHERE clause is incredibly versatile. You can use it with
              various operators to create different conditions:
            </p>
            <div class="concept">
              <ul>
                <li>=: <span class="redacted">Equal to</span></li>
                <li>
                  != or &lt;&gt;: <span class="redacted">Not equal to</span>
                </li>
                <li>&lt;: <span class="redacted">Less than</span></li>
                <li>&gt;: <span class="redacted">Greater than</span></li>
                <li>
                  &lt;=: Less than
                  <span class="redacted">or</span> equal to
                </li>
                <li>
                  &gt;=: Greater than <span class="redacted">or</span> equal to
                </li>
                <li>
                  LIKE: Matches a <span class="redacted">pattern</span> (e.g.,
                  '1985%')
                </li>
                <li>
                  BETWEEN: Within a <span class="redacted">range</span> of
                  values
                </li>
                <li>
                  IN: Matches <span class="redacted">any</span> value in a list
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p class="concept">
              You can even combine multiple conditions using <code>AND</code>,
              <code>OR</code>, and <code>NOT</code> to create more complex
              filters.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            By combining these clauses, you can craft queries that extract
            precisely the information you need. Let's put this into practice
            with a few examples.
          </p>

            <ol>
              <li>Open the "Execute SQL" tab in DB Browser.</li>
              <li>
                Try the following queries to retrieve specific data from the
                "movies_80s" table:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Retrieve the title and genre of all movies released in 1985.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Retrieve the title and distributor of movies with a rank
                    greater than 5.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Retrieve the title and release date of movies with the genre
                    "Comedy".
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Experiment with different combinations of SELECT, FROM, and
                WHERE to explore the dataset further.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              As you practice with these queries, you'll gain a deeper
              understanding of how to extract meaningful insights from the
              dataset. Feel free to experiment and explore the data to your
              heart's content!
